# Parse NASR Data for Airports API

The short term goal is to parse a few of the available fields from the [56 day
NASR data][2] in order to produce data for [airports-api][1].

The basic premise of parsing the [NASR data][2] with Ruby could be extracted to
its own project. This project also might serve as research for anyone looking
to undertake developing a more thorough parser.
