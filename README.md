# Parse the 56 Day NASR Subscription Data with Ruby

This is a work in progress.

The short term goal is to parse a few of the available fields in order to
produce data for the [airports-api][1].

The basic premise of parsing the [NASR data][2] with Ruby could branch easily
out to its own project.

## Source Data

Download the [56 Day NASR Subscription Data][2] and put it in the
`./subscription-data` directory.
